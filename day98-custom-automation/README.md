<h1>Day 98 - Custom automation - Job simple repetitive task:</h1>

<p>Automate some aspect of your life using Python. Every week I have to upload the hours I worked in my job. I automated that 5 minute process to be a 10 seconds process.
<br/> (The web page structure was horrible, it was a really good challenge to be able to find the elements within the frames).
<br/> Selenium, OOP </p>
