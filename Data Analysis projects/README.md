<p>This folder contains my data analysis projects from Angela Yu's course: 100 Days of code.
<br/> Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy, Pandas, Plotly </p>

  <br/>
  
<h2><b>Notebooks included:</b><br/></h2>
<b>Day73-Programming-Languages: </b> An analysis of the popularity of different programming languages over time.<br/><br/>
<b>Day74-LEGO-analysis: </b> Learn to Aggregate and Merge Data in Pandas while Analysing a Dataset of LEGO Pieces.<br/><br/>
<b>Day75-Google-Trends-data-visualisation: </b> Combine Google Trends with other Time Series Data.<br/><br/>
<b>Day76-Google-play-store-project: </b> Wrestle the Android App Store Data into Beautiful Looking Charts with Plotly.<br/><br/>
<b>Day77-Computation-with-NumPy: </b> Learn to work with ndarrays, access individual values and subsets inside an n-dimensional array, do linear algebra and manipulate images as ndarrays with NumPy.<br/><br/>
<b>Day78-Seaborn-Linear-Regression: </b> In this lesson, we're going to be looking at movie budget and revenue data. This dataset is perfect for trying out some new tools like scikit-learn to run a linear regression and seaborn, a popular data visualisation library built on top of Matplotlib.<br/><br/>
<b>Day79-Nobel-prize-analysis: </b> Today we're going to analyse a dataset on the past winners of the Nobel Prize. Let's see what patterns we can uncover in the past Nobel laureates and what can we learn about the Nobel prize and our world more generally.<br/><br/>
<b>Day80-Dr-Semmelweiss-analysis: </b> Today you will become a doctor, but not just any doctor. You will become Dr Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician born in 1818 who worked in the Vienna General Hospital.<br/><br/>
<b>Day81-Multivariable-regression: </b> Today you will: Analyse and explore the Boston house price data. Split your data for training and testing. Run a Multivariable Regression. Evaluate how your model's coefficients and residuals. Use data transformation to improve your model performance. Use your model to estimate a property price<br/><br/>
<b>Day99-Analyzing-the-space-race-Capstone-Project: </b> Use space mission data from 1957 onwards to analyse and visualise trends over time.<br/><br/>
<b>Day100-Analyze-deaths-involving-the-police-in-the-US-Capstone-Project: </b> Extract insights from combining US census data and the Washington Post's database on deaths by police in the United States.<br/><br/>
